# Damn Cool Programming Resources

## Where am i?

This is an index with all cool articles and sites i meet on the 
internet, named after [Damn Cool Algorithms][] article series, which, 
of course, is about to take honorable place in this repository.

There are certainly more cool articles on internet than anyone can read
and remember, so i needed some kind of a bookshelf, which this 
repository should serve as. 

The details of internal schema are yet to come; pull-requests are 
welcome for the dev branch.
